# Preprocess-Image-with-VGG16
# Melanoma is the most severe kind of cancer that is becoming more common in the Western world. Melanoma is still thought to be caused primarily by exposure to the sun. Patients    with malignant (advanced-stage) melanoma have a wide range of prognoses, however public awareness initiatives encouraging early detection have resulted in considerable reductions in mortality rates. This disease primarily affects Caucasian men and women and has a terrible prognosis once it has spread to other parts of the body. As a result, early detection of this malignancy is critical for patient treatment success. 
# This research is carried out to classify melanoma images with Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) using the VGG16 pathway for preprocessing the images. The problem statement is to build a melanoma classifier given some sets of lesion images with high accuracy.
